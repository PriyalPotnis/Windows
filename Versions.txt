*Versions
upto windows 98 it support only DOS. That means it does not recognise 64mb of ram instead it support FAT32 file system.
Do not recognise NTFS.
They lack repair feature hence it is impossible to replace motherboard you need to reinstall windows.
Lack memory protection so computer gets crash.

Then comes windows 2000 where there is repair feature available and also you can change motherboard without reinstalling windows.
It can recognise 4 gb ram but works better with 256mb ram. IE7 not supported. mozilla firefox can run.

Windows XP: It runs well on 1 gb ram. does not support IE9.

Windows Vista: Vista is really a waste version why because it works well only on 2 gb ram. thus pcs with less than 2 gb ram does not work well on vista. it supports IE9. runs faster supports 4gb ram. but does not supports periferrals of printers.

Windows 7: It overcomes disadvantages of windows vista. It is available with 32 bit and 64 bit.

Windows 8: Here start menu is removed with different gui
